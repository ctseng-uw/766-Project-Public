Chinese calligraphy has a history of thousands of years. Good handwriting or calligraphy is often regarded as a kind of cultural expression and also has visual art values. Some calligraphists’ works are so valuable that their works are worth millions of dollars. 

Below is one famous work "兰亭集序" from a famous calligraphist 王羲之. His handwriting style is natural and unrestrained, which is why his handwriting has been valued for years.

Many people are expecting that we can create a printable font based on their handwriting style. However, we only have a limited number of their works and there are more than 80,000 characters in Chinese. It is far from enough to create a font. Based on the description above, creating such a mapping model is both important and has many practical uses.

Most kids in China have at least a couple of calligraphy classes in school. At that time, students who have good handwriting may receive many compliments from the teachers. We are not the ones who have the best handwriting, and doing this project is kind of making our childhood dreams come true :blush:


The problem we want to solve is transferring Chinese handwriting fonts. We are expecting to transfer an existing font to a more personalized font, based on some pictures from the personalized font.
