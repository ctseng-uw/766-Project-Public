The existing approach to do is Generative Adversarial Network(GAN). In GAN, we train 2 models simultaneously, one is generator, which will generate destination\u2019s image from source input(the \u201cfake\u201d destination image), and another is discriminator, which will classify the images as either the real destination image or the generated \u201cfake\u201d image.
